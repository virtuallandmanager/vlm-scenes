# Basic Starter Scene for Virtual Land Manager

This **Basic Starter Scene** serves as an entry point for building a new **Decentraland SDK7** scene with **Virtual Land Manager** installed. This scene provides a simple, foundational template that you can build upon when creating your own Decentraland experiences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools ready:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
  Download and install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Decentraland SDK7 Extension for VS Code**  
  The Decentraland SDK7 extension will help you set up your scene. It also handles the installation of **Node.js** and other necessary dependencies for you. 

  Follow the steps in the [Decentraland SDK7 Installation Guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk7/installation-guide/) for detailed instructions on installing the extension and setting up your environment.

### Setting Up the Scene

3. **Create a New Scene via the Decentraland SDK7 Extension**

   - Search for `Decentraland: Create Project` and select it.

4. **Choose "From Github Repository" Option**
